# unsupervised-learning-project

The following project contains final work for class "unsupervied-learning" by professor Yoram Louzoun. <br>
The project contains full detailed code with comments representing the full project pipeline from data wrangling 
which located under the directory "data_preprocessing/". the directory includes data deletion and data encoding 
under the files - "data_eraser" & "data_encoder".<br>
to dimensions reduction of the data which located under the directory "data_inference/dimensions/". <br>
and finally to the clustering wise of the project which located under the directory "data_inference/clustering/".

other than the code section, the project contains full detailed verbal file documenting each step of the work, from 
data handling to statistical inference from data histograms, to inference from data correlations, to dimensions 
reductions documentations and what we can learn from it, and finally to clustering documentation and what each method
and result tell us about the data. <br>
<b> the file located under the directory "resources/" under the name "unsupervised learning diabetic data analysis.docx"</b>
## Installation

In order to test each section of the code, first install the dependencies of the project by writing the following 
commands at the CMD, under the main project directory: <br>
1) python -m venv venv
2) . venv/Scripts/activate
3) pip install -r requirements.txt

now, after your environment with all the dependencies are ready and activated, you can run each section of the code separately 
and view the outputs comfortably.
